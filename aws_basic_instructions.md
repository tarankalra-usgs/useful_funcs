These are the basic instructions for using AWS services that are equivalent to using a HPC system. They require no prior knowledge other than some basic familiarity with command line environments. A HPC type AWS cloud environment contains two resources that users would use and they include:
* EC2 -> Elastic Compute Cloud that is equivalent of having a machine to run the jobs.
* S3  -> Simple Storage Service that is where one can store (It is much cheaper to store here than EC2). 

#### 1. Obtaining a AWS account 
The AWS account for users is usually created by the overarching agency that is paying for those resources. 
It contains two pieces of information 
* Username and password that can be used to login directly to the AWS website (aws.amazon.com) in this case. The user can use the web console to login check the status of resources under Services tab. One example of this could be checking the status of EC2 whether it is running, what amount of resources are being utilized etc., several other options for users to setup their cloud environment.
